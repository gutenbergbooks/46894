<p>Volcanoes destroy and volcanoes create. The catastrophic eruption
of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, made clear the awesome
destructive power of a volcano. Yet, over a time span longer than
human memory and record, volcanoes have played a key role in forming
and modifying the planet upon which we live. More than 80 percent
of the Earth&rsquo;s surface&mdash;above and below sea level&mdash;is of volcanic
origin. Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents over hundreds of
millions of years formed the Earth&rsquo;s earliest oceans and atmosphere,
which supplied the ingredients vital to evolve and sustain life. Over
geologic eons, countless volcanic eruptions have produced mountains,
plateaus, and plains, which subsequent erosion and weathering
have sculpted into majestic landscapes and formed fertile soils.</p>
<p>Ironically, these volcanic soils and inviting terranes have attracted,
and continue to attract, people to live on the flanks of volcanoes.
Thus, as population density increases in regions of active or potentially
active volcanoes, mankind must become increasingly aware of the
hazards and learn not to &ldquo;crowd&rdquo; the volcanoes. People living in the
shadow of volcanoes must live in harmony with them and expect, and
should plan for, periodic violent unleashings of their pent-up energy.</p>
<p>This booklet presents a generalized summary of the nature, workings,
products, and hazards of the common types of volcanoes around
the world, along with a brief introduction to the techniques of volcano
monitoring and research.</p>

<p>On August 24, A.D. 79, Vesuvius
Volcano suddenly exploded and
destroyed the Roman cities of
Pompeii and Herculaneum. Although
Vesuvius had shown stirrings
of life when a succession of
earthquakes in A.D. 63 caused
some damage, it had been literally
quiet for hundreds of years and was
considered &ldquo;extinct.&rdquo; Its surface
and crater were green and covered
with vegetation, so the eruption was
totally unexpected. Yet in a few
hours, hot volcanic ash and dust
buried the two cities so thoroughly
that their ruins were not uncovered
for nearly 1,700 years, when the
discovery of an outer wall in 1748
started a period of modern archeology.
Vesuvius has continued its
activity intermittently ever since A.D.
79 with numerous minor eruptions
and several major eruptions occurring
in 1631, 1794, 1872, 1906 and
in 1944 in the midst of the Italian
campaign of World War II.</p>

<p>In the United States on March 27,
1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano in
the Cascade Range, southwestern
Washington, reawakened after more
than a century of dormancy and
provided a dramatic and tragic
reminder that there are active
volcanoes in the &ldquo;lower 48&rdquo; States
as well as in Hawaii and Alaska.
The catastrophic eruption of Mount
St. Helens on May 18, 1980, and
related mudflows and flooding
caused significant loss of life (57
dead or missing) and property
damage (over $1.2 billion). Mount
St. Helens is expected to remain intermittently
active for months or
years, possibly even decades.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;volcano&rdquo; comes from
the little island of Vulcano in the
Mediterranean Sea off Sicily. Centuries
ago, the people living in this
area believed that Vulcano was the
chimney of the forge of Vulcan&mdash;the
blacksmith of the Roman gods.
They thought that the hot lava fragments
and clouds of dust erupting
from Vulcano came from Vulcan&rsquo;s
forge as he beat out thunderbolts
for Jupiter, king of the gods, and
weapons for Mars, the god of war.
In Polynesia the people attributed
eruptive activity to the beautiful but
wrathful Pele, Goddess of Volcanoes,
whenever she was angry or
spiteful. Today we know that
volcanic eruptions are not supernatural
but can be studied and interpreted
by scientists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">The Nature of Volcanoes</span></h2>
<p>Volcanoes are mountains, but
they are very different from other
mountains; they are not formed by
folding and crumpling or by uplift
and erosion. Instead, volcanoes are
built by the accumulation of their
own eruptive products&mdash;lava, bombs
(crusted over lava blobs), ashflows,
and tephra (airborne ash and dust).
A volcano is most commonly a conical
hill or mountain built around a
vent that connects with reservoirs of
molten rock below the surface of the
Earth. The term volcano also refers
to the opening or vent through which
the molten rock and associated
gases are expelled.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_5">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="Fountaining lava and volcanic debris during the 1959 Kilauea Iki eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii." width="500" height="428" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">Fountaining lava and volcanic debris during the 1959 Kilauea Iki eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Driven by buoyancy and gas pressure
the molten rock, which is lighter
than the surrounding solid rock,
forces its way upward and may ultimately
break through zones of weaknesses
in the Earth&rsquo;s crust. If so,
an eruption begins, and the molten
rock may pour from the vent as non-explosive
lava flows, or it may shoot
violently into the air as dense clouds
of lava fragments. Larger fragments
fall back around the vent, and accumulations
of fall-back fragments
may move downslope as ash flows
under the force of gravity. Some of
the finer ejected materials may be
carried by the wind only to fall to
the ground many miles away. The
finest ash particles may be injected
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
miles into the atmosphere and carried
many times around the world
by stratospheric winds before
settling out.</p>
<p>Molten rock below the surface of
the Earth that rises in volcanic vents
is known as <i>magma</i>, but after it
erupts from a volcano it is called
<i>lava</i>. Originating many tens of miles
beneath the ground, the ascending
magma commonly contains some
crystals, fragments of surrounding
(unmelted) rocks, and dissolved
gases, but it is primarily a liquid
composed principally of oxygen,
silicon, aluminum, iron, magnesium,
calcium, sodium, potassium, titanium,
and manganese. Magmas also
contain many other chemical elements
in trace quantities. Upon
cooling, the liquid magma may precipitate
crystals of various minerals
until solidification is complete to
form an <i>igneous</i> or <i>magmatic rock</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_6">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="An idealized diagram of a volcano in an oceanic environment (left) and in a continental environment (right)." width="500" height="325" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">An idealized diagram of a volcano in an oceanic environment (left) and in a continental environment (right).</span></p>
</div>
<p>The diagram below shows that
heat concentrated in the Earth&rsquo;s upper
<i>mantle</i> raises temperatures sufficiently
to melt the rock locally by
fusing the materials with the lowest
melting temperatures, resulting in
small, isolated blobs of magma.
These blobs then collect, rise
through conduits and fractures, and
some ultimately may re-collect in
larger pockets or reservoirs (&ldquo;holding
tanks&rdquo;) a few miles beneath the
Earth&rsquo;s surface. Mounting pressure
within the reservoir may drive the
magma further upward through
structurally weak zones to erupt as
lava at the surface. In a continental
environment, magmas are generated
in the Earth&rsquo;s crust as well as
at varying depths in the upper mantle.
The variety of molten rocks in
the crust, plus the possibility of mixing
with molten materials from the
underlying mantle, leads to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
production of magmas with widely
different chemical compositions.</p>
<p>If magmas cool rapidly, as might
be expected near or on the Earth&rsquo;s
surface, they solidify to form igneous
rocks that are finely crystalline or
glassy with few crystals. Accordingly,
lavas, which of course are very
rapidly cooled, form volcanic rocks
typically characterized by a small
percentage of crystals or fragments
set in a matrix of <i>glass</i> (quenched
or super-cooled magma) or finer
grained crystalline materials. If
magmas never breach the surface
to erupt and remain deep underground,
they cool much more slowly
and thus allow ample time to sustain
crystal precipitation and growth, resulting
in the formation of coarser
grained, nearly completely crystalline,
igneous rocks. Subsequent to
final crystallization and solidification,
such rocks can be exhumed by erosion
many thousands or millions of
years later and be exposed as large
bodies of so-called <i>granitic</i> rocks,
as, for example, those spectacularly
displayed in Yosemite National Park
and other parts of the majestic Sierra
Nevada mountains of California.</p>
<p>Lava is red hot when it pours or
blasts out of a vent but soon changes
to dark red, gray, black, or some
other color as it cools and solidifies.
Very hot, gas-rich lava containing
abundant iron and magnesium is
fluid and flows like hot tar, whereas
cooler, gas-poor lava high in silicon,
sodium, and potassium flows sluggishly,
like thick honey in some
cases or in others like pasty, blocky

</div>
<p>All magmas contain dissolved
gases, and as they rise to the surface
to erupt, the confining pressures
are reduced and the dissolved gases
are liberated either quietly or explosively.
If the lava is a thin fluid (not
viscous), the gases may escape
easily. But if the lava is thick and
pasty (highly viscous), the gases will
not move freely but will build up tremendous
pressure, and ultimately
escape with explosive violence.
Gases in lava may be compared
with the gas in a bottle of a carbonated
soft drink. If you put your thumb
over the top of the bottle and shake
it vigorously, the gas separates from
the drink and forms bubbles. When
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
you remove your thumb abruptly,
there is a miniature explosion of
gas and liquid. The gases in lava
behave in somewhat the same way.
Their sudden expansion causes the
terrible explosions that throw out
great masses of solid rock as well
as lava, dust, and ashes.</p>
<p>The violent separation of gas from
lava may produce rock froth called
<i>pumice</i>. Some of this froth is so
light&mdash;because of the many gas
bubbles&mdash;that it floats on water. In
many eruptions, the froth is shattered
explosively into small fragments
that are hurled high into the
air in the form of volcanic cinders
(red or black), volcanic ash (commonly
tan or gray), and volcanic
dust.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">Principal Types of Volcanoes</span></h2>
<p>Geologists generally group volcanoes
into four main kinds&mdash;cinder
cones, composite volcanoes, shield
volcanoes, and lava domes.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Cinder cones</h3>
<p>Cinder cones are the simplest
type of volcano. They are built from
particles and blobs of congealed
lava ejected from a single vent. As
the gas-charged lava is blown violently
into the air, it breaks into
small fragments that solidify and fall
as <i>cinders</i> around the vent to form
a circular or oval cone. Most cinder
cones have a bowl-shaped <i>crater</i> at
the summit and rarely rise more
than a thousand feet or so above
their surroundings. Cinder cones
are numerous in western North
America as well as throughout other
volcanic terrains of the world.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_9">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="Schematic representation of the internal structure of a typical cinder cone." width="500" height="380" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">Schematic representation of the internal structure of a typical cinder cone.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In 1943 a cinder cone started
growing on a farm near the village
of Par&iacute;cutin in Mexico. Explosive
eruptions caused by gas rapidly expanding
and escaping from molten
lava formed cinders that fell back
around the vent, building up the
cone to a height of 1,200 feet. The
last explosive eruption left a funnel-shaped
crater at the top of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
cone. After the excess gases had
largely dissipated, the molten rock
quietly poured out on the surrounding
surface of the cone and moved
downslope as lava flows. This order
of events&mdash;eruption, formation of
cone and crater, lava flow&mdash;is a
common sequence in the formation
of cinder cones.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_10">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="Par&iacute;cutin Volcano, Mexico, is a cinder cone rising approximately 1,200 feet above the surrounding plain." width="500" height="518" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">Par&iacute;cutin Volcano, Mexico, is a cinder cone rising approximately 1,200 feet above the surrounding plain.</span></p>
</div>
<p>During 9 years of activity, Par&iacute;cutin
built a prominent cone, covered about
100 square miles with ashes, and
destroyed the town of San Juan.
Geologists from many parts of the
world studied Par&iacute;cutin during its
lifetime and learned a great deal
about volcanism, its products, and
the modification of a volcanic landform
by erosion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<h3 id="c4">Composite volcanoes</h3>
<p>Some of the Earth&rsquo;s grandest
mountains are <i>composite</i>
volcanoes&mdash;sometimes called
<i>stratovolcanoes</i>. They are typically
steep-sided, symmetrical cones of
large dimension built of alternating
layers of lava flows, volcanic ash,
cinders, blocks, and bombs and
may rise as much as 8,000 feet
above their bases. Some of the
most conspicuous and beautiful
mountains in the world are composite
volcanoes, including Mount
Fuji in Japan, Mount Cotopaxi in
Ecuador, Mount Shasta in California,
Mount Hood in Oregon, and
Mount St. Helens and Mount
Rainier in Washington.</p>
<p>Most composite volcanoes have a
crater at the summit which contains
a central vent or a clustered group
of vents. Lavas either flow through
breaks in the crater wall or issue
from fissures on the flanks of the
cone. Lava, solidified within the
fissures, forms dikes that act as ribs
which greatly strengthen the cone.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_11">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="Schematic representation of the internal structure of a typical composite volcano." width="500" height="457" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">Schematic representation of the internal structure of a typical composite volcano.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The essential feature of a composite
volcano is a conduit system
through which magma from a reservoir
deep in the Earth&rsquo;s crust rises
to the surface. The volcano is built
up by the accumulation of material
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
erupted through the conduit and increases
in size as lava, cinders,
ash, etc., are added to its slopes.</p>
<p>When a composite volcano becomes
dormant, erosion begins to
destroy the cone. As the cone is
stripped away, the hardened magma
filling the conduit (the volcanic
plug) and fissures (the dikes)
becomes exposed, and it too is
slowly reduced by erosion. Finally,
all that remains is the plug and dike
complex projecting above the land
surface&mdash;a telltale remnant of the
vanished volcano.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_12">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">Shishaldin Volcano, an imposing composite cone, towers 9,372 feet above sea level in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.</span></p>
</div>
<p>An interesting variation of a composite
volcano can be seen at
Crater Lake in Oregon. From what
geologists can interpret of its past,
a high volcano&mdash;called Mount
Mazama&mdash;probably similar in appearance
to present-day Mount
Rainier was once located at this
spot. Following a series of tremendous
explosions about 6,800 years
ago, the volcano lost its top. Enormous
volumes of volcanic ash and
dust were expelled and swept down
the slopes as ash flows and avalanches.
These large-volume explosions
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
rapidly drained the lava beneath
the mountain and weakened
the upper part. The top then collapsed
to form a large depression,
which later filled with water and is
now completely occupied by beautiful
Crater Lake. A last gasp of
eruptions produced a small cinder
cone, which rises above the water
surface as Wizard Island near the
rim of the lake. Depressions such
as Crater Lake, formed by collapse
of volcanoes, are known as <i>calderas</i>.
They are usually large,
steep-walled, basin-shaped depressions
formed by the collapse of a
large area over, and around, a
volcanic vent or vents. Calderas
range in form and size from roughly
circular depressions 1 to 15 miles in
diameter to huge elongated depressions
as much as 60 miles long.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<h3 id="c6">Shield volcanoes</h3>
<p>Shield volcanoes, the third type of
volcano, are built almost entirely of
fluid lava flows. Flow after flow
pours out in all directions from a
central <i>summit</i> vent, or group of
vents, building a broad, gently sloping
cone of flat, domical shape, with
a profile much like that of a warrior&rsquo;s
shield. They are built up slowly
by the accretion of thousands of
highly fluid lava flows called basalt
lava that spread widely over great
distances, and then cool as thin,
gently dipping sheets. Lavas also
commonly erupt from vents along
fractures (rift zones) that develop on
the flanks of the cone. Some of the
largest volcanoes in the world are
shield volcanoes. In northern California
and Oregon, many shield
volcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4
miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000
feet. The Hawaiian Islands are composed
of linear chains of these
volcanoes including Kilauea and
Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii&mdash;two
of the world&rsquo;s most active volcanoes.
The floor of the ocean is
more than 15,000 feet deep at the
bases of the islands. As Mauna Loa,
the largest of the shield volcanoes
(and also the world&rsquo;s largest active
volcano), projects 13,677 feet above
sea level, its top is over 28,000 feet
above the deep ocean floor.</p>
<p>In some eruptions, basaltic lava
pours out quietly from long fissures
instead of central vents and floods
the surrounding countryside with lava
flow upon lava flow, forming broad
plateaus. Lava plateaus of this type
can be seen in Iceland, southeastern
Washington, eastern Oregon, and
southern Idaho. Along the Snake
River in Idaho, and the Columbia
River in Washington and Oregon,
these lava flows are beautifully exposed
and measure more than a
mile in total thickness.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">A sketch of the havoc wrought in St. Pierre Harbor on Martinique during the eruption of Mont Pel&eacute;e in 1902.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Volcanic or lava domes are
formed by relatively small, bulbous
masses of lava too viscous to flow
any great distance; consequently,
on extrusion, the lava piles over
and around its vent. A dome grows
largely by expansion from within. As
it grows its outer surface cools and
hardens, then shatters, spilling
loose fragments down its sides.
Some domes form craggy knobs or
spines over the volcanic vent,
whereas others form short, steep-sided
lava flows known as &ldquo;coulees.&rdquo;
Volcanic domes commonly
occur within the craters or on the
flanks of large composite volcanoes.
The nearly circular Novarupta Dome
that formed during the 1912 eruption
of Katmai Volcano, Alaska,
measures 800 feet across and 200
feet high. The internal structure of
this dome&mdash;defined by layering of
lava fanning upward and outward
from the center&mdash;indicates that it
grew largely by expansion from
within. Mont Pel&eacute;e in Martinique,
Lesser Antilles, and Lassen Peak
and Mono domes in California are
examples of lava domes. An extremely
destructive eruption
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
accompanied the growth of a dome
at Mont Pel&eacute;e in 1902. The coastal
town of St. Pierre, about 4 miles
downslope to the south, was demolished
and nearly 30,000 inhabitants
were killed by an incandescent,
high-velocity ash flow and associated
hot gases and volcanic dust.
Only two men survived; one because
he was in a poorly ventilated,
dungeon-like jail cell and the other
who somehow made his way safely
through the burning city.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><br /><span class="small">Other Volcanic Structures</span></h2>
<h3 id="c9">Plugs (necks)</h3>
<p>Congealed magma, along with
fragmental volcanic and wallrock
materials, can be preserved in the
feeding conduits of a volcano upon
cessation of activity. These preserved
rocks form crudely cylindrical
masses, from which project
radiating dikes; they may be
visualized as the fossil remains of
the innards of a volcano (the so-called
&ldquo;volcanic plumbing system&rdquo;)
and are referred to as volcanic
<i>plugs</i> or <i>necks</i>. The igneous material
in a plug may have a range of
composition similar to that of associated
lavas or ash, but may also
include fragments and blocks of
denser, coarser grained rocks&mdash;higher
in iron and magnesium,
lower in silicon&mdash;thought to be
samples of the Earth&rsquo;s deep crust
or upper mantle plucked and transported
by the ascending magma.
Many plugs and necks are largely
or wholly composed of fragmental
volcanic material and of fragments
of wallrock, which can be of any
type. Plugs that bear a particularly
strong imprint of explosive eruption
of highly gas-charged magma are
called <i>diatremes</i> or <i>tuff-breccia</i>.</p>
<p>Volcanic plugs are believed to
overlie a body of magma which
could be either still largely liquid or
completely solid depending on the
state of activity of the volcano.
Plugs are known, or postulated, to
be commonly funnel shaped and to
taper downward into bodies increasingly
elliptical in plan or elongated
to dike-like forms. Typically, volcanic
plugs and necks tend to be more
resistant to erosion than their
enclosing rock formations. Thus,
after the volcano becomes inactive
and deeply eroded, the exhumed
plug may stand up in bold relief as
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
an irregular, columnar structure.
One of the best known and most
spectacular diatremes in the United
States is Ship Rock in New Mexico,
which towers some 1,700 feet
above the more deeply eroded surrounding
plain. Volcanic plugs,
including diatremes, are found elsewhere
in the western United States
and also in Germany, South Africa,
Tanzania, and Siberia.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<h3 id="c10">Maars</h3>
<p>Also called &ldquo;tuff cones,&rdquo; <i>maars</i>
are shallow, flat-floored craters that
scientists interpret have formed
above diatremes as a result of a
violent expansion of magmatic gas
or steam; deep erosion of a maar
presumably would expose a diatreme.
Maars range in size from
200 to 6,500 feet across and from
30 to 650 feet deep, and most are
commonly filled with water to form
natural lakes. Most maars have low
rims composed of a mixture of
loose fragments of volcanic rock
and rocks torn from the walls of the
diatreme.</p>
<p>Maars occur in the western United
States, in the Eifel region of
Germany, and in other geologically
young volcanic regions of the world.
An excellent example of a maar is
Zuni Salt Lake in New Mexico, a
shallow saline lake that occupies a
flat-floored crater about 6,500 feet
across and 400 feet deep. Its low
rim is composed of loose pieces of
basaltic lava and wallrocks (sandstone,
shale, limestone) of the
underlying diatreme, as well as random
chunks of ancient crystalline
rocks blasted upward from great
depths.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h3 id="c11">Nonvolcanic craters</h3>
<p>Some well-exposed, nearly circular
areas of intensely deformed
sedimentary rocks, in which a central
vent-like feature is surrounded
by a ring-shaped depression, resemble
volcanic structures in gross
form. As no clear evidence of volcanic
origin could be found in or
near these structures, scientists initially
described them as &ldquo;cryptovolcanic,&rdquo;
a term now rarely used.
Recent studies have shown that not
all craters are of volcanic origin. Impact
craters, formed by collisions
with the Earth of large meteorites,
asteroids, or comets, share with
volcanoes the imprints of violent
origin, as evidenced by severe
disruption, and even local melting,
of rock. Fragments of meteorites or
chemically detectable traces of extraterrestrial
materials and indications
of strong forces acting from
above, rather than from below,
distinguish impact from volcanic
features.</p>
<p>Other possible explanations for
these nonvolcanic craters include
subsurface salt-dome intrusion (and
subsequent dissolution and collapse);
collapse caused by subsurface
limestone dissolution and/or
ground-water withdrawal; and collapse
related to melting of glacial
ice. An impressive example of an
impact structure is Meteor Crater,
Ariz., which is visited by thousands
of tourists each year. This impact
crater, 4,000 feet in diameter and
600 feet deep, was formed in the
geologic past (probably 30,000-50,000
years before present) by a
meteorite striking the Earth at a
speed of many thousands of miles
per hour.</p>
<p>In addition to Meteor Crater, very
fresh, morphologically distinct, impact
craters are found at three sites
near Odessa, Tex., as well as 10 or
12 other locations in the world. Of
the more deeply eroded, less obvious,
postulated impact structures,
there are about ten well-established
sites in the United States and perhaps
80 or 90 elsewhere in the
world.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><br /><span class="small">Types of Volcanic Eruptions</span></h2>
<p>During an episode of activity, a
volcano commonly displays a distinctive
pattern of behavior. Some
mild eruptions merely discharge
steam and other gases, whereas
other eruptions quietly extrude
quantities of lava. The most spectacular
eruptions consist of violent
explosions that blast great clouds of
gas-laden debris into the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>The type of volcanic eruption is
often labeled with the name of a
well-known volcano where characteristic
behavior is similar&mdash;hence
the use of such terms as &ldquo;Strombolian,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Vulcanian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vesuvian,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pel&eacute;an,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hawaiian,&rdquo; and others.
Some volcanoes may exhibit only
one characteristic type of eruption
during an interval of activity&mdash;others
may display an entire sequence of
types.</p>
<p>In a Strombolian-type eruption
observed during the 1965 activity of
Iraz&uacute; Volcano in Costa Rica, huge
clots of molten lava burst from the
summit crater to form luminous arcs
through the sky. Collecting on the
flanks of the cone, lava clots combined
to stream down the slopes in
fiery rivulets.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_27">

</div>
<p>In contrast, the eruptive activity of
Par&iacute;cutin Volcano in 1947 demonstrated
a &ldquo;Vulcanian&rdquo;-type eruption,
in which a dense cloud of ash-laden
gas explodes from the crater and
rises high above the peak. Steaming
ash forms a whitish cloud near
the upper level of the cone.</p>
<p>In a &ldquo;Vesuvian&rdquo; eruption, as typified
by the eruption of Mount
Vesuvius in Italy in A.D. 79, great
quantities of ash-laden gas are
violently discharged to form a
cauliflower-shaped cloud high above
the volcano.</p>

occurred on the Mayon Volcano in
the Philippines in 1968, a large
quantity of gas, dust, ash, and incandescent
lava fragments are
blown out of a central crater, fall
back, and form tongue-like, glowing
avalanches that move downslope at
velocities as great as 100 miles per
hour. Such eruptive activity can
cause great destruction and loss of
life if it occurs in populated areas,
as demonstrated by the devastation
of St. Pierre during the 1902 eruption
of Mont Pel&eacute;e on Martinique,
Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawaiian&rdquo; eruptions may occur
along fissures or fractures that
serve as linear vents, such as during
the eruption of Mauna Loa
Volcano in Hawaii in 1950; or they
may occur at a central vent such as
during the 1959 eruption in Kilauea
Iki Crater of Kilauea Volcano,
Hawaii. In fissure-type eruptions,
molten, incandescent lava spurts
from a fissure on the volcano&rsquo;s rift
zone and feeds lava streams that
flow downslope. In central-vent
eruptions, a fountain of fiery lava
spurts to a height of several hundred
feet or more. Such lava may
collect in old pit craters to form lava
lakes, or form cones, or feed
radiating flows.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phreatic&rdquo; (or steam-blast) eruptions
are driven by explosive expanding
steam resulting from cold
ground or surface water coming into
contact with hot rock or magma.
The distinguishing feature of phreatic
explosions is that they only
blast out fragments of preexisting
solid rock from the volcanic conduit;
no new magma is erupted. Phreatic
activity is generally weak, but can
be quite violent in some cases,
such as the 1965 eruption of Taal
Volcano, Philippines, and the
1975-76 activity at La Soufri&egrave;re,
Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles).</p>
<p>The most powerful eruptions are
called &ldquo;plinian&rdquo; and involve the explosive
ejection of relatively viscous
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
lava. Large plinian eruptions&mdash;such
as during 18 May 1980 at Mount St.
Helens or, more recently, during 15
June 1991 at Pinatubo in the
Philippines&mdash;can send ash and
volcanic gas tens of miles into the
air. The resulting ash fallout can affect
large areas hundreds of miles
downwind. Fast-moving deadly
pyroclastic flows (&ldquo;nu&eacute;es ardentes&rdquo;)
are also commonly associated with
plinian eruptions.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><br /><span class="small">Submarine Volcanoes</span></h2>
<p>Submarine volcanoes and volcanic
vents are common features
on certain zones of the ocean floor.
Some are active at the present time
and, in shallow water, disclose their
presence by blasting steam and
rock-debris high above the surface
of the sea. Many others lie at such
great depths that the tremendous
weight of the water above them
results in high, confining pressure
and prevents the formation and explosive
release of steam and gases.
Even very large, deep-water eruptions
may not disturb the ocean
surface.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_33">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="Schematic representation of a typical submarine eruption in the open ocean." width="500" height="451" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">Schematic representation of a typical submarine eruption in the open ocean.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The unlimited supply of water surrounding
submarine volcanoes can
cause them to behave differently
from volcanoes on land. Violent,
steam-blast eruptions take place
when sea water pours into active
shallow submarine vents. Lava,
erupting onto a shallow sea floor or
flowing into the sea from land, may
cool so rapidly that it shatters into
sand and rubble. The result is the
production of huge amounts of
fragmental volcanic debris. The
famous &ldquo;black sand&rdquo; beaches of
Hawaii were created virtually instantaneously
by the violent interaction
between hot lava and sea water. On
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the other hand, recent observations
made from deep-diving submersibles
have shown that some submarine
eruptions produce flows and
other volcanic structures remarkably
similar to those formed on land. Recent
studies have revealed the
presence of spectacular, high-temperature
hydrothermal plumes
and vents (called &ldquo;smokers&rdquo;) along
some parts of the mid-oceanic volcanic
rift systems. However, to
date, no direct observation has
been made of a deep submarine
eruption in progress.</p>
<p>During an explosive submarine
eruption in the shallow open ocean,
enormous piles of debris are built
up around the active volcanic vent.
Ocean currents rework the debris in
shallow water, while other debris
slumps from the upper part of the
cone and flows into deep water
along the sea floor. Fine debris and
ash in the eruptive plume are scattered
over a wide area in airborne
clouds. Coarse debris in the same
eruptive plume rains into the sea
and settles on the flanks of the
cone. Pumice from the eruption
floats on the water and drifts with
the ocean currents over a large
area.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><br /><span class="small">Geysers, Fumaroles, and Hot Springs</span></h2>
<p>Geysers, fumaroles (also called
<i>solfataras</i>), and hot springs are
generally found in regions of young
volcanic activity. Surface water percolates
downward through the rocks
below the Earth&rsquo;s surface to high-temperature
regions surrounding a
magma reservoir, either active or
recently solidified but still hot. There
the water is heated, becomes less
dense, and rises back to the surface
along fissures and cracks.
Sometimes these features are called
&ldquo;dying volcanoes&rdquo; because they
seem to represent the last stage of
volcanic activity as the magma, at
depth, cools and hardens.</p>
<p>Erupting geysers provide spectacular
displays of underground
energy suddenly unleashed, but
their mechanisms are not completely
understood. Large amounts of hot
water are presumed to fill underground
cavities. The water, upon
further heating, is violently ejected
when a portion of it suddenly
flashes into steam. This cycle can
be repeated with remarkable
regularity, as for example, at Old
Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National
Park, which erupts on an
average of about once every 65
minutes.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_35">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">Old Faithful Geyser, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Fumaroles, which emit mixtures
of steam and other gases, are fed
by conduits that pass through the
water table before reaching the surface
of the ground. Hydrogen sulfide
(H<sub>2</sub>S), one of the typical gases
issuing from fumaroles, readily oxidizes
to sulfuric acid and native
sulfur. This accounts for the intense
chemical activity and brightly colored
rocks in many thermal areas.</p>
<p>Hot springs occur in many thermal
areas where the surface of the
Earth intersects the water table.
The temperature and rate of discharge
of hot springs depend on
factors such as the rate at which
water circulates through the system
of underground channelways, the
amount of heat supplied at depth,
and the extent of dilution of the
heated water by cool ground water
near the surface.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><br /><span class="small">Volcano Environments</span></h2>
<p>There are more than 500 active
volcanoes (those that have erupted
at least once within recorded history)
in the world&mdash;50 of which
are in the United States (Hawaii,
Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and
California)&mdash;although many more
are hidden under the seas. Most active
volcanoes are strung like beads
along, or near, the margins of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>

the Pacific Ocean as a &ldquo;Ring
of Fire.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Many volcanoes are in and
around the Mediterranean Sea.
Mount Etna in Sicily is the largest
and highest of these mountains.
Italy&rsquo;s Vesuvius is the only active
volcano on the European mainland.
Near the island of Vulcano, the
volcano Stromboli has been in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
state of nearly continuous, mild
eruption since early Roman times.
At night, sailors in the Mediterranean
can see the glow from the
fiery molten material that is hurled
into the air. Very appropriately,
Stromboli has been called &ldquo;the
lighthouse of the Mediterranean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some volcanoes crown island
areas lying near the continents, and
others form chains of islands in the
deep ocean basins. Volcanoes tend
to cluster along narrow mountainous
belts where folding and fracturing
of the rocks provide channelways
to the surface for the escape
of magma. Significantly, major
earthquakes also occur along these
belts, indicating that volcanism and
seismic activity are often closely
related, responding to the same
dynamic Earth forces.</p>
<p>In a typical &ldquo;island-arc&rdquo; environment,
volcanoes lie along the crest
of an arcuate, crustal ridge bounded
on its convex side by a deep
oceanic trench. The granite or
granitelike layer of the continental
crust extends beneath the ridge to
the vicinity of the trench. Basaltic
magmas, generated in the mantle
beneath the ridge, rise along fractures
through the granitic layer.
These magmas commonly will be
modified or changed in composition
during passage through the granitic
layer and erupt on the surface to
form volcanoes built largely of non-basaltic
rocks.</p>

<p>In a typical &ldquo;oceanic&rdquo; environment,
volcanoes are aligned along
the crest of a broad ridge that
marks an active fracture system in
the oceanic crust. Basaltic magmas,
generated in the upper mantle
beneath the ridge, rise along fractures
through the basaltic layer.
Because the granitic crustal layer
is absent, the magmas are not appreciably
modified or changed in
composition and they erupt on the
surface to form basaltic volcanoes.</p>

<p>In the typical &ldquo;continental&rdquo; environment,
volcanoes are located in
unstable, mountainous belts that
have thick roots of granite or granitelike
rock. Magmas, generated
near the base of the mountain root,
rise slowly or intermittently along
fractures in the crust. During
passage through the granitic layer,
magmas are commonly modified or
changed in composition and erupt
on the surface to form volcanoes

</div>
<p>According to the now generally
accepted &ldquo;plate-tectonics&rdquo; theory,
scientists believe that the Earth&rsquo;s
surface is broken into a number of
shifting slabs or plates, which average
about 50 miles in thickness.
These plates move relative to one
another above a hotter, deeper,
more mobile zone at average rates
as great as a few inches per year.
Most of the world&rsquo;s active volcanoes
are located along or near the boundaries
between shifting plates and
are called &ldquo;plate-boundary&rdquo; volcanoes.
However, some active
volcanoes are not associated with
plate boundaries, and many of
these so-called &ldquo;intra-plate&rdquo;
volcanoes form roughly linear
chains in the interior of some
oceanic plates. The Hawaiian
Islands provide perhaps the best
example of an &ldquo;intra-plate&rdquo; volcanic
chain, developed by the northwest-moving
Pacific plate passing over
an inferred &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; that initiates
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the magma-generation and volcano-formation
process. The peripheral
areas of the Pacific Ocean Basin,
containing the boundaries of several
plates, are dotted by many active
volcanoes that form the so-called
&ldquo;Ring of Fire.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Ring&rdquo; provides
excellent examples of &ldquo;plate-boundary&rdquo;
volcanoes, including
Mount St. Helens.</p>
<p>The accompanying figure shows
the boundaries of lithosphere plates
that are presently active. The double
lines indicate zones of spreading
from which plates are moving apart.
The lines with barbs show zones of
underthrusting (subduction), where
one plate is sliding beneath another.
The barbs on the lines indicate
the overriding plate. The single line
defines a strike-slip fault along
which plates are sliding horizontally
past one another. The stippled
areas indicate a part of a continent,
exclusive of that along a plate
boundary, which is undergoing active
extensional, compressional, or
strike-slip faulting.</p>

<p>Volcanoes and volcanism are
not restricted to the planet Earth.
Manned and unmanned planetary
explorations, beginning in the late
1960&rsquo;s, have furnished graphic
evidence of past volcanism and its
products on the Moon, Mars, Venus
and other planetary bodies. Many
pounds of volcanic rocks were collected
by astronauts during the
various Apollo lunar landing missions.
Only a small fraction of these
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
samples have been subjected to exhaustive
study by scientists. The
bulk of the material is stored under
controlled-environment conditions at
NASA&rsquo;s Lunar Receiving Laboratory
in Houston, Tex., for future study by
scientists.</p>
<p>From the 1976-1979 Viking mission,
scientists have been able to
study the volcanoes on Mars, and
their studies are very revealing
when compared with those of
volcanoes on Earth. For example,
Martian and Hawaiian volcanoes
closely resemble each other in
form. Both are shield volcanoes,
have gently sloping flanks, large
multiple collapse pits at their centers,
and appear to be built of fluid
lavas that have left numerous flow
features on their flanks. The most
obvious difference between the two
is size. The Martian shields are
enormous. They can grow to over
17 miles in height and more than
350 miles across, in contrast to a
maximum height of about 6 miles
and width of 74 miles for the
Hawaiian shields.</p>
<p>Voyager-2 spacecraft images
taken of Io, a moon of Jupiter,
captured volcanoes in the actual
process of eruption. The volcanic
plumes shown on the image rise
some 60 to 100 miles above the
surface of the moon. Thus, active
volcanism is taking place, at present,
on at least one planetary body
in addition to our Earth.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><br /><span class="small">Volcano Monitoring and Research</span></h2>
<p>It has been said that the science
of &ldquo;volcanology&rdquo; originated with the
accurate descriptions of the eruption
of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 contained
in two letters from Pliny the
Younger to the Roman historian
Tacitus. Pliny&rsquo;s letters also described
the death of his uncle, Pliny
the Elder, who was killed in the
eruption. Actually, however, it was
not until the 19th century that serious
scientific inquiry into volcanic
phenomena flourished as part of the
general revolution in the physical
and life sciences, including the new
science of &ldquo;geology.&rdquo; In 1847, an
observatory was established on the
flanks of Vesuvius, upslope from
the site of Herculaneum, for the
more or less continuous recording
of the activity of the volcano that
destroyed the city in A.D. 79. Still,
through the first decade of the 20th
century, the study of volcanoes by
and large continued to be of an expeditionary
nature, generally undertaken
after the eruption had begun
or the activity had ceased.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">The U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, on the crater rim of Kilauea Volcano.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps &ldquo;modern&rdquo; volcanology
began in 1912, when Thomas A.
Jaggar, Head of the Geology Department
of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, founded the
Hawaiian Volcano Observatory
(HVO), located on the rim of
Kilauea&rsquo;s caldera. Initially supported
by an association of Honolulu
businessmen, HVO began to conduct
systematic and continuous
monitoring of seismic activity
preceding, accompanying, and
following eruptions, as well as a
wide variety of other geological,
geophysical, and geochemical
observations and investigations.
Between 1919 and 1948, HVO was
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
administered by various Federal
agencies (National Weather Service,
U.S. Geological Survey, and National
Park Service), and since 1948
it has been operated continuously
by the Geological Survey as part of
its Volcano Hazards Program. The
more than 75 years of comprehensive
investigations by HVO and
other scientists in Hawaii have added
substantially to our understanding
of the eruptive mechanisms of
Kilauea and Mauna Loa, two of the
world&rsquo;s most active volcanoes.
Moreover, the Hawaiian Volcano
Observatory pioneered and refined
most of the commonly used
volcano-monitoring techniques
presently employed by other observatories
monitoring active volcanoes
elsewhere, principally in Indonesia,
Italy, Japan, Latin America, New
Zealand, Lesser Antilles (Caribbean),
Philippines, and Kamchatka
(U.S.S.R.).</p>
<p>What does &ldquo;volcano monitoring&rdquo;
actually involve? Basically, it is the
keeping of a detailed &ldquo;diary&rdquo; of the
changes&mdash;visible and invisible&mdash;in a
volcano and its surroundings. Between
eruptions, visible changes of
importance to the scientists would
include marked increase or decrease
of steaming from known
vents; emergence of new steaming
areas; development of new ground
cracks or widening of old ones;
unusual or inexplicable withering
of plant life; changes in the color
of mineral deposits encrusting
fumaroles; and any other directly
observable, and often measurable,
feature that might reflect a change
in the state of the volcano. Of
course, the &ldquo;diary&rdquo; keeping during
eruptive activity presents additional
tasks. Wherever and whenever they
can do so safely, scientists document,
in words and on film, the
course of the eruption in detail;
make temperature measurements of
lava and gas; collect the eruptive
products and gases for subsequent
laboratory analysis; measure the
heights of lava fountains or ash
plumes; gage the flow rate of ash
ejection or lava flows; and carry out
other necessary observations and
measurements to fully document
and characterize the eruption. For
each eruption, such documentation
and data collection and analysis
provide another building block in
constructing a model of the characteristic
behavior of a given
volcano or type of eruption.</p>
<p>Volcano monitoring also involves
the recording and analysis of volcanic
phenomena not visible to the
human eye, but measurable by
precise and sophisticated instruments.
These phenomena include
ground movements, earthquakes
(particularly those too small to be
felt by people), variations in gas
compositions, and deviations in
local electrical and magnetic fields
that respond to pressure and
stresses caused by the subterranean
magma movements.</p>
<p>Some common methods used to
study invisible, volcano-related
phenomena are based on:</p>
<p>1. Measurement of changes
in the shape of the volcano&mdash;volcanoes
gradually swell or &ldquo;inflate&rdquo;
in building up to an eruption
because of the influx of magma into
the volcano&rsquo;s reservoir or &ldquo;plumbing
system&rdquo;; with the onset of eruption,
pressure is immediately relieved
and the volcano rapidly
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
shrinks or &ldquo;deflates.&rdquo; A wide variety
of instruments, including precise
spirit-levels, electronic &ldquo;tiltmeters,&rdquo;
and electronic-laser beam instruments,
can measure changes in
the slope or &ldquo;tilt&rdquo; of the volcano or
in vertical and horizontal distances
with a precision of only a few parts
in a million.</p>
<p>2. Precise determination of the
location and magnitude of earthquakes
by a well-designed seismic
network&mdash;as the volcano inflates by
the rise of magma, the enclosing
rocks are deformed to the breaking
point to accommodate magma
movement. When the rock ultimately
fails to permit continued magma
ascent, earthquakes result. By carefully
mapping out the variations with
time in the locations and depths of
earthquake foci, scientists in effect
can track the subsurface movement
of magma, horizontally and
vertically.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">Scientist, wearing asbestos gloves and gas mask, samples volcanic gases from active vent.</span></p>
</div>
<p>3. Measurement of changes in
volcanic-gas composition and in
magnetic field&mdash;the rise of magma
high into the volcanic edifice may
allow some of the associated gases
to escape along fractures, thereby
causing the composition of the
gases (measured at the surface) to
differ from that usually measured
when the volcano is quiescent and
the magma is too deep to allow gas
to escape. Changes in the Earth&rsquo;s
magnetic field have been noted
preceding and accompanying some
eruptions, and such changes are
believed to reflect temperature
effects and/or the content of
magnetic minerals in the magma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Recording historic eruptions and
modern volcano-monitoring in themselves
are insufficient to fully determine
the characteristic behavior of
a volcano, because a time record of
such information, though perhaps
long in human terms, is much too
short in geologic terms to permit
reliable predictions of possible
future behavior. A comprehensive
investigation of any volcano must
also include the careful, systematic
mapping of the nature, volume, and
distribution of the products of prehistoric
eruptions, as well as the
determination of their ages by
modern isotopic and other dating
methods. Research on the volcano&rsquo;s
geologic past extends the
data base for refined estimates of
the recurrence intervals of active
versus dormant periods in the
history of the volcano. With such information
in hand, scientists can
construct so-called &ldquo;volcanic
hazards&rdquo; maps that delineate the
zones of greatest risk around the
volcano and that designate which
zones are particularly susceptible to
certain types of volcanic hazards
(lava flows, ash fall, toxic gases,
mudflows and associated flooding,
etc.).</p>
<p>A strikingly successful example of
volcano research and volcanic-hazard
assessment was the 1978
publication (Bulletin 1383-C) by two
Geological Survey scientists, Dwight
Crandell and Donal Mullineaux, who
concluded that Mount St. Helens
was the Cascade volcano most frequently
active in the past 4,500
years and the one most likely to
reawaken to erupt, &ldquo;... perhaps
before the end of this century.&rdquo;
Their prediction came true when
Mount St. Helens rumbled back to
life in March of 1980. Intermittent
explosions of ash and steam and
periodic formation of short-lived lava
domes continued throughout the
decade. Analysis of the volcano&rsquo;s
past behavior indicates that this
kind of eruptive activity may continue
for years or decades, but
another catastrophic eruption like
that of May 18, 1980, is unlikely to
occur soon.</p>
<p>On 18 May 1982, the U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) formally
dedicated the David A. Johnston
Cascades Volcano Observatory
(CVO) in Vancouver, Washington, in
memory of the Survey volcanologist
killed two years earlier. This
facility&mdash;a sister observatory to the
Hawaiian Volcano Observatory&mdash;facilitates
the increased monitoring
and research on not only Mount St.
Helens but also the other volcanoes
of the Cascade Range of the Pacific
Northwest. More recently, in cooperation
with the State of Alaska, the
USGS established the Alaska Volcano
Observatory in March 1988.
The work being done at these
volcano observatories provides important
comparisons and contrasts
between the behavior of the generally
non-explosive Hawaiian shield
volcanoes and that of the generally
explosive composite volcanoes
of the Cascade and Alaskan
Peninsula-Aleutian chains.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><br /><span class="small">Volcanoes and People</span></h2>
<p>Volcanoes both harass and help
mankind. As dramatically demonstrated
by the catastrophic eruption
of Mount St. Helens on May 1980
and of Pinatubo in June 1991,
volcanoes can wreak havoc and
devastation in the short term. The
types of volcanic and associated
hazards are not described in this
booklet but treated in several of the
publications listed in
<a href="#c20"><i><b>Suggested Reading</b></i></a>.
However, it should be emphasized
that the short-term hazards
posed by volcanoes are balanced
by benefits of volcanism and
related processes over geologic
time. Volcanic materials ultimately
break down to form some of the
most fertile soils on Earth, cultivation
of which fostered and sustained
civilizations. People use volcanic
products as construction materials,
as abrasive and cleaning agents,
and as raw materials for many
chemical and industrial uses. The
internal heat associated with some
young volcanic systems has been
harnessed to produce geothermal
energy. For example, the electrical
energy generated from The Geysers
geothermal field in northern California
can meet the present power
consumption of the city of San
Francisco.</p>
<p>The challenge to scientists involved
with volcano research is to
mitigate the short-term adverse impacts
of eruptions, so that society
may continue to enjoy the long-term
benefits of volcanism. They must
continue to improve the capability
for predicting eruptions and to provide
decision makers and the general
public with the best possible
information on high-risk volcanoes
for sound decisions on land-use
planning and public safety. Geo-scientists
still do not fully understand
how volcanoes really work,
but considerable advances have
been made in recent decades. An
improved understanding of volcanic
phenomena provides important
clues to the Earth&rsquo;s past, present,
and possibly its future.</p>
